# Chapter Template title

Write a brief description and overview of the goal to be achieved with the
workflows and documentation described in the chapter. This template provides
guidance for formatting chapters, but you can change the format depending on the
topic.

- _What goals does this chapter help achieve?_
- _What questions does this chapter answer?_
- _Why should I care about the contents of this chapter?_

## Assumptions and Prerequisites

Describe the tools or applications you need to successfully execute the
workflow.

- _What version of SystemLink is needed?_
- _What state or configuration must SystemLink be in?_
- _Are there any licensing requirements that must be met?_
- _Are there third party applications that must be in place?_
- _Are there tools that must be installed to complete the workflows_

## Section N

Break down the rest of the chapter into sections and subsections as needed.
These should describe workflows plus any context that other users might find
helpful.

- _-Does this workflow use any common command line operations?_
- _How do I get started with installing or setting up any required tools?_

### Inline images

Screen shots are encouraged, as they can help clarify workflows and make content
easier to read. However, screenshots may also become outdated as the product
changes.

Using inline HTML is recommended by MkDocs to allow for proper captioning.
