## Upgrade Considerations

### RabbitMQ Version

SystemLink Enterprise includes a deployment of the [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message bus. Since you cannot skip minor versions when updating RabbitMQ, you may not be able to upgrade directly between versions of the SystemLink Enterprise product. The table below shows the version of the RabbitMQ dependency for each released version of SystemLink Enterprise. Refer to [Updating SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/updating-systemlink-enterprise.html) for detailed update instructions.
