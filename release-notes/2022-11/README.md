## Upgrading from the 2022-09 Release to the 2022-11 Release

Due to breaking changes in the top level SystemLink and SystemLink-Admin Helm chart the following procedure is required to upgrade the application. Note, this upgrade will cause any currently executing notebooks to fail.

1. Stage your workspace to upgrade the `systemlink-admin` and `systemlink` helm charts to the 2022-11 release.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command to remove existing Argo CRDs. This command should include all flags and value file references you would expect to use for a typical upgrade of the application.

    **Note:** This wil result in an expected failure: `UPGRADE FAILED: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "WorkflowTemplate" in version "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"`. This error can be ignored.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the argo CRDs have been deleted.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command for the `systemlink-admin` helm chart.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the new argo CRDs have been installed.

1. Run the helm upgrade command for the `systemlink` Helm chart.
