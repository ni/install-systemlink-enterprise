The 2022-11 release bundle for SystemLink Enterprise has been published to <https://niedge01.jfrog.io>. Work with your account representative to obtain credentials to access these artifacts. If you are not upgrading from the previous release, refer to past release notes to ensure you have addressed all required configuration changes.

## Upgrading from the 2022-09 Release to the 2022-11 Release

When you upgrade, you must complete the following steps to avoid breaking changes in the top-level SystemLink and SystemLink-Admin Helm chart. Note, this upgrade will cause any currently executing notebooks to fail.

1. Stage your workspace to upgrade the `systemlink-admin` and `systemlink` helm charts to the 2022-11 release.

1. Before you upgrade the `systemlink-admin` chart, run the Helm upgrade command on the `systemlink` chart to remove existing Argo CRDs. This command must include all flags and value file references you would use for a typical application upgrade.

    **Note:** This will result in an expected failure: `UPGRADE FAILED: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "WorkflowTemplate" in version "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"`. Ignore this error.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the argo CRDs have been deleted. You may need to manually delete remaining CRDs if the Helm upgrade command does not remove all of these objects.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command for the `systemlink-admin` helm chart.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the new argo CRDs have been installed.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command for the `systemlink` Helm chart.
