## Upgrading from the 09-2022 Release to the 11-2022 Release

Due to breaking changes in the top level SystemLink and SystemLink-Admin Helm chart the following procedure is required to upgrade the application. Note, this upgrade will cause any currently executing notebooks to fail.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command to remove existing Argo CRDs using the 11-2022 release against your cluster running the 09-2022 release. 

    **Note:** This wil result in an expected failure: `PGRADE FAILED: unable to recognize "": no matches for kind "WorkflowTemplate" in version "argoproj.io/v1alpha1"`. This error can be ignored.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the argo CRDs have been deleted.

1. Run the Helm upgrade command for the `systemlink-admin` helm chart.

1. Run the command `kubectl get crds | grep argo` to verify the new argo CRDs have been installed.
