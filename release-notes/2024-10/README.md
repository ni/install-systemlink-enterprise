## New Features and Behavior changes

- Changes to privileges and roles
    - Added "Routines" service role.
    - Added "Routine Maintainer" role.
    - Added "Enable" and "Disable" privileges to routines.
    - Added "Cancel notebook execution" privilege. This privilege is not currently enforced.
    - Renamed the "Modify metadata" routine privilege to "Modify routines."
    - "Notebook Execution" privilege category was renamed to "Scripts" to match the application rename
- As a result of the privilege changes above, non-admin users that could previously perform operations on Routines may not be able to any longer. These users should either be applied the "Routine Maintainer" role or have a new role created that grants Routine privileges.
- Routines must now be disabled in order to be updated unless the user has all of enable, disable, and modify privileges.

## Upgrade Considerations

### RabbitMQ Version

SystemLink Enterprise includes a deployment of the [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message bus. Since you cannot skip minor versions when updating RabbitMQ, you may not be able to upgrade directly between versions of the SystemLink Enterprise product. The table below shows the version of the RabbitMQ dependency for each released version of SystemLink Enterprise. Refer to [Updating SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/updating-systemlink-enterprise.html) for detailed update instructions.

| 3.12.x           | 0.16.x                              | 0.24.x                             |
