## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- TODO

- All Charts `TODO top level chart version`
    - Containers inside a Pod now use a stricter `securityContext` configuration by default.
    - The new default `securityContext` configuration for containers is as follows:
        - `allowPrivilegeEscalation` defaults to `false`
        - `readOnlyRootFilesystem` defaults to `true`
        - `privileged` defaults to `false`
        - `capabilities.drop` defaults to `[all]`.
    - This change only affects the default values of _Containers_. The default values for the _Pod_ `securityContext` remain the same.
- `license 0.1.0`
    - This service requires the persistent storage class `ReadWriteMany`.
    - Configure secrets for the service
        - Refer to [systemlink-secrets.yaml](https://github.com/ni/install-systemlink-enterprise/blob/main/release-notes/2022-12/templates/systemlink-secrets.yaml)
        - Refer to [Required Secrets](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/required-secrets.html)
    - Configure values for the service
        - Refer to [systemlink-values.yaml](https://github.com/ni/install-systemlink-enterprise/blob/main/getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml)

    - Config map renamed from `nbexec-service-argo-configmap` to `<helm_release_name>-nbexecservice-argo-configmap`.
    - Service names were moved from config map to workflow-template.
    - During helm upgrade in progress executions may fail.
- `routineservice 0.2.0`
    - The contents of the `routineservice` helm chart have been split into two charts": `routineservice` and `routineeventtrigger`
    - There are no breaking changes to the existing chart but some values and secrets can be removed or renamed.
        - Within `userservices.secrets.whitelistedApiKeys`, `routines` can be removed and `routineeventtrigger` should be added.
        - The `routineservice.engine` configuration is deprecated. If you used this configuration, migrate by moving it under `routineeventtrigger`. 
- `routineeventtrigger 0.2.0`
    - Some components from the "routineservice" into the `routineeventtrigger` chart.
    - Refer to [systemlink-secrets.yaml](TODO Link) for required changes
