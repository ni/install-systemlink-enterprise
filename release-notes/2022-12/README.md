# SystemLink Enterprise 2022-12 Release Notes

The 2022-12 release bundle for SystemLink Enterprise has been published to <https://niedge01.jfrog.io>. Work with your account representative to obtain credentials to access these artifacts. If you are not upgrading from the previous release, refer to past release notes to ensure you have addressed all required configuration changes.

## New Features and Behavior changes

- The top level helm chart includes the License service. Refer to **Helm Chart Breaking Changes** for details on the required configuration for this service.
- Users can specify data table IDs as variables in dashboards.
- Users can customize, filter, save, and load views in the Products grid.
- Users can upload and view files associated with a product.
- Users can filter the Executions grid by date ranges and workspaces.

## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- `systemlink 0.9.88`, `systemlink-admin 0.9.4`
    - Containers inside a Pod now use a more strict `securityContext` configuration by default.
    - The new default `securityContext` configuration for containers is as follows:
        - `allowPrivilegeEscalation` defaults to `false`
        - `readOnlyRootFilesystem` defaults to `true`
        - `privileged` defaults to `false`
        - `capabilities.drop` defaults to `[all]`.
    - This change only affects the default values of _Containers_. The default values for _Pod_ `securityContext` remains the same.
- `license 0.1.0`
    - This service requires the persistent storage class `ReadWriteMany`.
    - Configure secrets for the service
        - Refer to [systemlink-secrets.yaml](https://github.com/ni/install-systemlink-enterprise/blob/2022-12/getting-started/templates/systemlink-secrets.yaml)
        - Refer to [Required Secrets](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/required-secrets.html)
    - Configure values for the service
        - Refer to [systemlink-values.yaml](https://github.com/ni/install-systemlink-enterprise/blob/2022-12/getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml)
        - Refer to [What Do You Need to Use SystemLink Enterprise?](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/systemlink-enterprise-requirements.html)
- `nbexecservice 0.1.312`
    - Config map renamed from `nbexec-service-argo-configmap` to `<helm_release_name>-nbexecservice-argo-configmap`.
    - Service names have been moved from config map to workflow-template.
    - During helm upgrade in progress executions may fail.
