## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- Top Level Helm Chart 0.7.x
    - `podSecurityContext` has been moved out of `initialAdministratorMapping` and into the top level hierarchy of the `systemlink-value.yaml` file
    - Removed `nbexecworker-apikey` and added `nbexec-argo-workflow-apikey`
    - `nbexecservice` depends on a new bucket for the service: `systemlink-notebook-execution`
    - Added configuration for `argoworkflows` and `nbexecservice`. See [getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml](/getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml) for an example configuration.
    - The default PVC storage size for the MongoDB replica set for `nbexecservice` has increased to 50Gi, which causes Helm upgrade to fail. You manually patch these PVC sizes to allow for Helm upgrade complete successfully. Refer to [increase_nbexec_mongo_storage.sh](increase_nbexec_mongo_storage.sh) for a script to patch there PVCs You may also delete the existing PVCs if losing notebook execution history is not an issue for your installation. Refer to [delete_nbexec_mongo_storage.sh](delete_nbexec_mongo_storage.sh) for a script to delete the existing PVCs.
- DataFrameService 0.7.x
    - The requirement from the previous release to set `dataframeservice.schema-registry.externalKafka.auth.jaas.password` in the `systemlink-values.yaml` file or via `--set` has been resolved. This setting can be removed from  your values files.
- Admin Helm chart 0.7.x
    - `strimzi-kafka-operator` now requires `defaultImageRegistry` and `imagePullSecrets` to be specified in the `systemlink-admin-values.yaml` file. You must also continue to include these values in `systemlink-values.yaml`. Refer to [getting-started/templates/systemlink-admin-values.yaml](/getting-started/templates/systemlink-admin-values.yaml) for an example of this configuration for `strimzi-kafka-operator`.
