## Breaking changed in Helm charts

- Top Level Helm Chart 0.7.x
    - `podSecurityContext` has been moved out of `initialAdministratorMapping` and into the top level hierarchy of the `systemlink-value.yaml` file
    - Removed `nbexecworker-apikey` and added `nbexec-argo-workflow-apikey`
    - `nbexecservice` depends on a new bucket for the service: `systemlink-notebook-execution`
    - Added configuration for `argoworkflows` and `nbexecservice`. See [getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml](/getting-started/templates/systemlink-values.yaml) for an example configuration.
    - The default PVC storage size for the MongoDB replica set for `nbexecservice` has increased to 50Gi, which causes Helm upgrade to fail. You manually patch these PVC sizes to allow for Helm upgrade complete successfully. You may also delete the existing PVCs if losing notebook execution history is not an issue for your installation.
- DataFrameService 0.7.x
    - The requirement from the previous release to set `dataframeservice.schema-registry.externalKafka.auth.jaas.password` in the `systemlink-values.yaml` file or via `--set` has been resolved. This setting can be removed from  your values files.
- Admin Helm chart 0.7.x
    - `strimzi-kafka-operator` now requires `defaultImageRegistry` and `imagePullSecrets` to be specified in the `systemlink-admin-values.yaml` file. You must also continue to include these values in `systemlink-values.yaml`. Refer to [getting-started/templates/systemlink-admin-values.yaml](/getting-started/templates/systemlink-admin-values.yaml) for an example of this configuration for `strimzi-kafka-operator`.
