previous release, refer to past release notes to ensure you have addressed all
required configuration changes.

## Upgrading from the release 2025-09 to the release 2025-10

<!-- Optional section to include comments and instructions needed to successfully upgrade from the previous release to the current release. If the only changes needed are already captured in Helm Chart Breaking Changes, this section is not needed. -->

## New Features and Behavior changes

- `assetservice:0.28.*`
  - The **Move assets between locations** privilege was introduced. Asset
    location movement API will use this privilege instead of **Modify assets**.
  - Physical locations are migrated to the new Location Service. For each
    physical location string of each asset, a location will be created with the
    same name in the respective Asset's workspace. Each asset will then
    reference the corresponding location ID instead of the previously location
    string. Considerations:
    - If multiple assets share the same workspace and have the same physical
      location name, a single corresponding location is created.
    - If multiple assets are in different workspaces and have the same physical
      location name, different corresponding locations are created, matching the
      workspaces.
    - Location service enforces a limit of 500 characters for the name, so any
      longer physical locations names will be trimmed during the migration
    - Location service forbids the usage of the `/` (forward slash) character in
      location names, since it is used in the path property. If this character
      is found during the migration, it will be replaced by `\` (backward
      slash).
- `locationservice:0.1.*`
  - Added new chart to SLE for Location Service. This requires additional
    Mongodb credentials to be provided.
    - [View this secret configuration](https://github.com/ni/install-systemlink-enterprise/blob/2025-10/getting-started/templates/systemlink-secrets.yaml#L190)
  - New privileges for the location service have been added: **List and view
    locations**, **Create locations**, **Modify locations**, and **Delete
    locations**.
  - The **List and view locations** privilege is now required in order to view
    the physical location name of each asset in the Assets UI.
- `dataframeservice:1.22.*`
  - Enabled Cross Origin Requests for Query tables route
    `/nidataframe/v1/query-tables`.
  - The DataFrame service now enforces generated a 16 MB limit in parquet data
    files footers. Previously, if the footer was too large, data table append
    requests would succeed with a HTTP `204` response. With this change, the
    append request will now return an HTTP `413` error, and logs will describe
    the issue and information about the request that was rejected.
- `DynamicFormFields:0.11.*`
  - Added DFF rules to configuration. DFF rules provide the ability to define
    rules for a view, group and field which will control a property of this
    object (visibility, mandatory, editable).
- Dashboards
  - CORS requests now allowed from dashboards.

## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- `userservices:0.35.*`
  - User Services will no longer start if the
    `userservices.secrets.continuationTokenEncryptionKey` Helm value is
    incorrectly formatted.
  - Previously, if the key was invalid the service would start and report errors
    when a request to `POST /niuser/v1/users/query` required the service to
    generate a continuation token.
  - If user services refuses to start after upgrading, review pod logs for
    `Invalid continuation token encryption key. The key must be a 32-byte value which is base64 encoded.`
- `dataframeservice:1.22.*`
  - A new Helm value, `dataframeservice.ingestion.arrow.maxRecordBatchSize`,
    determines how much memory the service may use when handling an append data
    request in the Apache Arrow format.
  - Existing applications only append data using JSON and are not affected.
    However, as applications are updated to use Arrow, you must ensure the
    `maxRecordBatchSize` limit is set correctly based on the
    `dataframeservice.resources.limits.memory` and
    `dataframeservice.rateLimits.ingestion.requestsLimit`.
  - When the DataFrame Service is configured with default resources, no change
    is required. Otherwise, `maxRecordBatchSize` may need to be adjusted. For
    example, the pilot configuration has been updated to set
    `maxRecordBatchSize` to 16MiB.

Remove unneeded initialization for workorder-apikey. This key was misnamed and
used for internal performance test. The work order service does not require a
whitelisted API key. Add initialization for workordereventprocessor-apikey. The
work order event processor (currently in development) needs an API key to
authorize background requests to the routine service.

## Upgrade Considerations

### RabbitMQ Version

SystemLink Enterprise includes a deployment of the
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message bus. Because you cannot skip minor
versions when updating RabbitMQ, you may not be able to upgrade directly between
versions of SystemLink Enterprise.

The following table displays the version of the RabbitMQ dependency for each
released version of SystemLink Enterprise. For more detailed update
instructions, refer to
[Updating SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/updating-systemlink-enterprise.html).
