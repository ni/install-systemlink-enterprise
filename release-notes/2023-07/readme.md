# SystemLink Enterprise 2023-07 Release Notes

The 2023-07 release of SystemLink Enterprise has been published to <https://downloads.artifacts.ni.com>. This update includes new features, bug fixes, and security updates. Work with your account representative to obtain credentials to access these artifacts. If you are not upgrading from the previous release, refer to past release notes to ensure you have addressed all required configuration changes.

## Upgrading from the 2023-06 or previous release to 2023-07

This release includes an updated saltmaster service that will cause previously connected systems to become disconnected upon upgrade. Refer to the [systems connection migration instructions](./SystemsConnectionMigration.md) to minimize the required effort to reconnect these systems.

This release includes Dremio Enterprise. This upgrade requires the removal of previous Dremio volumes.

1. Prior to upgrade, mark for deletion all persistent volume claims with `dremio` in their name.
2. Upgrade using the`systemlink 0.15.52` chart.
3. Kubernetes will automatically create new Dremio persistent volume claims.

**Note:** If this procedure was not completed prior to upgrade you must delete all `dremio` persistent volume claims, delete all `dremio` pods, and delete all `dataframeservice` pods. Kubernetes will automatically schedule new pods to replaced the deleted pods and new PVCs will be automatically created.
