## New Features and Behavior changes

## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- dataframeservice 0.11.21
    - Upgraded to Dremio Enterprise. When upgrading from a free version of Dremio to Dremio Enterprise, Dremio's volumes need to be cleared out. 
	- Before upgrading, mark all persistent volume claims with "dremio" in their names for deletion (you can just delete them from Lens). 
	- When the Dremio pods restart during the upgrade, the volume claims will be released and the Dremio pods will get fresh volumes. 
	- If this isn't done before upgrading, the steps to recover are to delete all of the "dremio" persistent volume claims, bounce all of the Dremio pods (to release the claims), and then bounce a DFS pod (to trigger logic to re-initialize Dremio).
	
- saltmaster 1.0.0
    - The new saltmaster helm chart is coming with 2 breaking changes:
		1. It is now using mongo so we will need to provide the mongodb credentials for the secret to be created: "saltmaster.secrets.mongodb"
		2. The helm chart now needs a pair of RSA keys (private & public) for securing the communication with the SL clients. There are instructions in the migration plan for getting the current pair of keys and setting them accordingly to "saltmaster.secrets.saltmaster" in order to create the necessary secret.
