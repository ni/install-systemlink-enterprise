# Migrating Connected Systems to SLE 2023-07 or later

The 2023-07 release introduces a breaking change in systems connectivity that
affects prior releases. The saltmaster service which manages the connectivity
with the client systems has been replaced with a new implementation that
disconnects all connected clients upon upgrade. Complete the following steps to
re-approve and re-connect all previously connected clients.

## Prior to upgrading to SLE 2023-07

The old saltmaster uses a pair of RSA keys to secure communication. The public
key is already cached on all accepted clients. You must persist these keys
between the upgrade of SLE, so the client systems do not reject the new
saltmaster's public key.

1. Open a terminal to the current `saltmaster-0` pod.
2. Navigate to `/etc/salt/pki/master`
3. Make a note of the `master.pem` (private key) and `master.pub` (public key)
   values.
4. Set these values to the secrets definition object of the saltmaster chart in
   the top level secrets values yaml file. Make sure you use the '|' indicator
   because these are multiline strings. Refer to <https://yaml-multiline.info/>
   for details on this character's usage.

The updated chart will create a Kubernetes secret using these two keys.

## Post SLE Upgrade

After the upgrade, all previously connected (green/orange systems) will be shown
as **Disconnected**. Additionally, these clients will also be shown in the
**Pending systems** list. You can use the
[Jupyter Notebook](./NewSaltMaster-SystemsMigration.ipynb) provided to automate
system approval. This notebook will add systems to the workspace they were
previously a member of. The user who runs the notebook must have the **Add
systems** privilege in all the necessary workspaces.

1. Ensure all systems are disconnected and appear in the pending systems list.
1. Upload `NewSaltMaster-SystemsMigration.ipynb` to JupyterHub.
1. Identify a single system to validate the notebook operation.
1. Override `managed_systems_to_approve` with its id and workspace. The notebook
   already contains this line, we only need to uncomment it and add the id and
   workspace:

   ```python
   managed_systems_to_approve = [{"id":"Precision_5570--SN-GPP8WT3--MAC-15-75-5B-DC-5F-BB","workspace":"846e294a-a007-47ac-9fc2-fac07eab240a"}]
   ```

1. Run the notebook and check the output. It should say that one system was
   approved.

   ```python
   Approving 1 batches of 50 systems
   Approving 1 minions, batch: 1
   [{'action': 'ACCEPT',
   'id': 'Precision_5570--SN-GPP8WT3--MAC-15-75-5B-DC-5F-BB',
   'key': None,
   'workspace': '846e294a-a007-47ac-9fc2-fac07eab240a'}]
   Manage Systems Keys Result: {} {'error': None}
   ```

1. Validate that the selected system is now connected (green).

   **Note** Misconfiguration of the RSA keys for the salt master may cause this
   operation to fail. Review the new secrets and
   [logs on the client system](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000kGcSSAU&l=en-US)

1. After connecting this single system, you can now uncomment the override of
   `managed_systems_to_approve` and run the notebook again.

   ```python
   # managed_systems_to_approve = [{"id":"Precision_5570--SN-GPP8WT3--MAC-15-75-5B-DC-5F-BB","workspace":"846e294a-a007-47ac-9fc2-fac07eab240a"}]
   ```

   **Note** The new run will re-approve all the systems in batches of 50 (this
   can also be modified in the notebook)

1. Ensure all the previously connected clients are connected (green).
1. [Optional] Delete the PVCs and volumes used by the old implementation. PVC
   names: `saltmaster-pillar-saltmaster-0` and `saltmaster-pki-saltmaster-0`.
