# A chart can be an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that you can package into versioned archives
# and deploy.
#
# Library charts provide utilities or functions for the chart developer. They are included as
# a dependency of application charts to add those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. You cannot deploy library charts because they do not define any templates.
type: application

# This is the chart version. Increment the version number each time you make changes
# to the chart, chart templates, or the app version.
# Ensure that you follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/).
version: 0.1.0

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# NI recommends putting the version number in quotes.
appVersion: '1.16.0'
