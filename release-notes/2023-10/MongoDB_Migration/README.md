# Existing MongoDB Data Migration to a Single Instance

## Do you need to worry about what is in this folder?

SystemLink Enterprise installations prior to 2023-10 deployed a MongoDB instance
per service. Version 2023-10 uses a global MongoDB connection string that allows
customers to consolidate over 20 different MongoDB instances down to one. This
content is for users who need to migrate existing SystemLink Enterprise MongoDB
data to a single MongoDB instance. You do not need to perform the following if
you are deploying a new installation of SystemLink Enterprise.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must provision your MongoDB instance with databases and
users. Refer to
[Configuring SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/config-systemlink-enterprise.html)
for a list of databases and password fields to update if using separate
credentials per database. NOTE: Ensure that you backup the current database
passwords before the migration.

## Enable a Single Instance

Refer to
[Configuring SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/config-systemlink-enterprise.html)
for instructions on editing the Helm values that determine this functionality.

## Migration Plan

### MongoDB Atlas

If you are using a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.ni.com/r/mongodbatalas) cluster
use the MongoDB Atlas migration tools to move data between the service databases
and MongoDB Atlas.

### Self-hosted MongoDB

Run the following command from inside the cluster to migrate the documents to
the new MongoDB instance.

```sh
mongodump --config=/etc/mongodump_config.yaml --archive | mongorestore --archive --config=/etc/mongorestore_config.yaml
```

Where

- `mongo*_config.yaml` is where the connection string and password are
  configured.
- `--archive` allows you to pipe (`|`) the output directly into the
  `mongorestore` command

#### Helm Chart

This folder includes a Helm Chart to install into your existing Kubernetes
cluster to execute the plan described above for self-hosted MongoDB. Your
Kubernetes cluster must be able to pull the
`bitnami/mongodb:5.0.19-debian-11-r3` Docker image.

1. Fill out the `values.yaml` file with MongoDB password secrets stored in
   `systemlink-secrets.yaml`. Refer to all `<ATTENTION>` comments.
2. Change active directory on command line to the folder containing this file.
3. Run `helm install ni-systemlink-enterprise-migrate-mongodb .`

You can observe the progress of each command Job through the Pod logs.

Before continuing, run `kubectl get jobs` and observe the `COMPLETIONS` column
to ensure all Jobs have completed. `1/1` indicates the Job completed
successfully.
