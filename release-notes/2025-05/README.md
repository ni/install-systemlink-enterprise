# SystemLink Enterprise 2025-05 Release Notes

The 2025-05 release for SystemLink Enterprise has been
published to <https://downloads.artifacts.ni.com>. This update includes new
features, bug fixes, and security updates. Work with your account representative
to obtain credentials to access these artifacts. If you are not upgrading from
the previous release, refer to past release notes to ensure you have addressed
all required configuration changes.

## Upgrading from the 2025-04 to the 2025-05

<!-- Optional section to include comments and instructions needed to successfully upgrade from the previous release to the current release. If the only changes needed are already captured in Helm Chart Breaking Changes, this section is not needed. -->

## New Features and Behavior changes

- `dataframeservice:1.17.62`
  - The filter given to the query-tables API is now limited to 20,000 characters. Filters that contain a large number of chained operators such as `or` may receive a 400 Bad Request response with an error message indicating the filter is too complex.
- `alarmservice:0.12.64`
  -  New secret required for alarmservic-apikey. Refer to Required Secrets in help.
  -  New secret required for alarmserviceroutineexecutor-apikey. Refer to Required Secrets in help.
  -  Alarms service now uses RabbitMQ credentials secret, typically shared by multiple charts. Refer to Required Secrets in help.

## Helm Chart Breaking Changes

- `dataframeservice:1.17.62`
  - The dataframeservice Helm values under `ingestion.s3StreamPool` have been replaced with the values under `ingestion.streamPool`. Setting the old values will result in an error from Helm.
  - To migrate to the new values, set 1ingestion.streamPool.maximumPooledStreams1 to the old `ingestion.s3StreamPool.maximumPooledStreams` value, then set `ingestion.streamPool.bufferSize` to the product of the old `ingestion.s3StreamPool.blocksPerBuffer` and `ingestion.s3StreamPool.blockSize` values. For example, the old default values were blocksPerBuffer=3 and blockSize=5MiB, so the new default value is bufferSize=15MiB.

## Upgrade Considerations

### RabbitMQ Version

SystemLink Enterprise includes a deployment of the
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) message bus. Since you cannot skip minor
versions when updating RabbitMQ, you may not be able to upgrade directly between
versions of SystemLink Enterprise. The table below shows the version of the
RabbitMQ dependency for each released version of SystemLink Enterprise. Refer to
[Updating SystemLink Enterprise](https://www.ni.com/docs/en-US/bundle/systemlink-enterprise/page/updating-systemlink-enterprise.html)
for detailed update instructions.
